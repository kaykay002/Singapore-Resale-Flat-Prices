## Machine Learning Model Building and Its Evaluation via Resale Price Prediction

## Overview
This project involved building and evaluating machine learning models for regression task. 
The goal was to predict the Singapore's Flat Resale Prices for regression. The project also included creating a Streamlit web page for easy interaction with the models.

## Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
- Identified skewness and outliers in the dataset.
- Understood the distribution and relationships between variables.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Transformed the data into a suitable format.
- Handled any missing values, outliers, or skewness.
- Performed necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps.

### 3. Regression Modeling
- Trained regression models to predict the continuous variable 'Resale_Price'.
- Evaluated models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

### 3. Model Optimization
- Optimized model hyperparameters using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to find the best-performing models.

### 5. Streamlit Web Application
- Developed a Streamlit web page where users could input values for each column.
- Implemented functionality to predict Resale Prices of flats in Singapore based on the input values using the trained models.
